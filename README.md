# Solar System Model 🌌

## Overview

This project is a visual representation of the solar system created using HTML and CSS. It simulates the orbits of the planets around the sun with an interactive and animated design. 🚀🌟

## Features

- **Planetary Orbits 🌍:** Displays the solar system with planets orbiting around the sun.
- **Dynamic Animation ⏱️:** Each planet has its own rotation speed, reflecting their real-life orbital periods in a proportional ratio.
- **Visual Design 🎨:** Utilizes radial gradients and animations to create a visually appealing representation of the planets and the sun.
- **Responsive Layout 📱:** Adjusts to different screen sizes while maintaining the layout and proportions of the solar system.

## How to View 🌐

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the solar system model.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML 🖥️:** For structuring the solar system model.
- **CSS 🎨:** For styling and animating the planets and sun.

## Installation 🛠️

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the solar system.

## Movement Proportionality 🔄

The speed at which the planets orbit in this model is proportional to their real-life orbital periods. Each planet's rotation time in the animation reflects its relative orbital period compared to the other planets, providing a scaled representation of their movement around the sun.
